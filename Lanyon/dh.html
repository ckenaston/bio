              <h3>Digital Projects</h3>
              <h3><i>Land and Legacy</i></h3>
              <p> This project investigates the land development and expansion of the University of Virginia 
                (UVA) and University of Virginia Foundation (UVAF) throughout Charlottesville and  Albemarle County since the 1980s. 
                The project focuses on how these changes have affected local  communities, reshaped city and county topography, and contributed to local inequities.
                 <i>Land and Legacy</i> was created by the 2019-2020 Praxis fellows: Janet S. Dunkelbarger, Natasha Roth-Rowland, Lauren Van Nest, Chloe Downe Wells, and me.
                  Based at the Scholars’ Lab at the UVA Library, Praxis fellows receive training in digital methods and tools as well as the task to create a digital humanities project. 
                In addition to the guidance and assistance provided by the Scholars’ Lab  staff, we also consulted with library staff, researchers working on the 
                Charlottesville Equity Atlas, and other members of the UVA and Charlottesville community. </p>
                <p>I played several roles on the project. Our team adopted a rotating project manager model. My time as the project manager coincided with the closing of UVA due to 
                  the coronavirus pandemic. As the project manager, I helped the team reassess our priorities and goals in light of our new circumstances, as well as create a detailed
                  project plan to help us achieve our goals. In my work as a project manager, I tried to <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/praxis-in-a-pandemic/">always lead with care</a>.  
                  I also served as one of the team's two primary web developers. We chose to build our own website with the layout, image resolution, and overall appearance tested for maximum accessibility, in order to encourage 
                  and facilitate public engagement, as well as to create additional space for acknowledging the people and projects that contributed to its own work. Building a website 
                  also allowed for easy access to the team’s data that informed our three ArcGIS StoryMaps as well as to our policy recommendations and avenues for future research. Finally, I also collaborated
                  to research, write, and edit our StoryMaps.</p>
